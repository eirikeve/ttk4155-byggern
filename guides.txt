To install toolchain, run: 
$ sudo sh install_toolchain.sh
in an arbitrary folder.

To open serial monitor, run:
$ sudo minicom -s
and enter "Serial port setup" nd make sure the settings are:
    For node 1: Serial device = /dev/ttyS0
    For node 2: Serial device = /dev/ttyACM0

    Both nodes: Bps/Par/Bits = 9600 8N2
Then hit ENTER, and navigate to EXIT, which brings up the serial monitor.

When flashing node2, the serial monitor must be closed because both the programmer and the serial monitor uses the same serial line.
To exit minicom, ender Ctrl + A, Z. Then enter Q for exit, and hit ENTER.

After node2 is flashed, the serial monitor can be opened again, and the same steps must be followed to enter the correct settings.

If using another computer and getting an error saying that you don't have access to the serial port, enter the command
$ sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyACM0

If using the normal computer, we have 3 different instances of the repo cloned locally:
~/Documents/Byggern/:   The "Official" repo where we do our main development, branch: /feature/finished_game. (You should be here when working on the main game). 
~/1asd/Byggern/: This repo is at the feature/display_sram branch, and used for testing of the display.
~/temp/Byggern/ (I believe this is the correct path):   Repo we used for development of snake, branch: feature/snake.
